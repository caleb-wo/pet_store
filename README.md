### Description:
Ever since I've gained interest in programming and web development there have been 2 frameworks that always caught my mind with interest: Ruby/On Rails and Java/Spring Framework. 

This is the project that I used to learn On Rails web development. I made an effort to build a clean, functional, and idiomatic Rails application. It performs CRUD operations on the underlying SQLite database and styling dynamics are obtained with Hotwire.


### Run as User:
*I plan to write scripts to set up a demo environment.*
### Run as Admin:
*This is where I'll include instruction to use the admin environment.*
### Lessons:
* The biggest lesson learned from this project was how to truly utilize A.I. for my learning, without inhibiting my ability for deep learning.
* *More will be added...*
